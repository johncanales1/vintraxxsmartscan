/**
 * notify-command.ts — pg_notify wrapper for the gateway-direction command
 * channel.
 *
 * Why a separate channel from `gps_event`:
 *   • `gps_event` is BACKEND→listener→WS clients. Dropping a message there
 *     is a missed UI update, recoverable on refresh.
 *   • `gps_command` is BACKEND→GATEWAY. Dropping a message means a queued
 *     command sits in the DB until the device reconnects (handled by the
 *     dispatcher's poll-on-bind sweep). Losses are tolerable but separation
 *     keeps the semantics clean.
 *
 * Payload format: just `{ commandId }`. The dispatcher does the row lookup
 * itself so we don't have to keep this struct stable across versions.
